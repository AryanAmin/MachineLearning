That's because the \"predict\" method always expects a 2D array as the format of its inputs. And putting our values into a double pair of square brackets makes the input exactly a 2D array.\n","\n","**Important note 2:** Notice also that the \"France\" country was not input as a string in the last column but as \"0, 0\" in the first two columns. That's because of course the predict method expects the dummy values of the Geography variable."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"tJj5k2MxZga3"},"source":["## Part 3: Evaluating the model"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"o0oyfLWoaEGw"},"source":["### Making the Confusion Matrix"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.metrics import confusion_matrix\n","confusion_matrix(y_test, y_pred)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"olDlHz4KwfC0","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1663515335596,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":12,"user":{"displayName":"Hadelin de Ponteves","userId":"15047218817161520419"}},"outputId":"99aeb222-11a6-4b90-b6d1-8b1ed15c1cb7"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["array([[1526,   69],\n","       [ 199,  206]])"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":27}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### Accuracy"],"metadata":{"id":"0l_6GuspajAC"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["(1521+208)/(1521+208+74+197)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"N_m2QvdVx20S","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1663515335596,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Hadelin de Ponteves","userId":"15047218817161520419"}},"outputId":"1bf92ad1-59e8-444b-92d6-d30bbb407fad"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.8645"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":28}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score\n","accuracy_score(y_test, y_pred)"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"AwPSlrVbycVw","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1663515335597,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":9,"user":{"displayName":"Hadelin de Ponteves","userId":"15047218817161520419"}},"outputId":"9a1cb91e-e337-4f1b-f6d8-019cf0e975eb"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["0.866"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":29}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["### k-Fold Cross Validation"],"metadata":{"id":"6jn64zWSbiQg"}},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.model_selection import cross_val_score\n","accuracies = cross_val_score(estimator = model,\n","                             X = X,\n","                             y = y,\n","                             scoring = 'accuracy',\n","                             cv = 10)\n","print(\"Average Accuracy: {:.2f} %\".format(accuracies.mean()*100))\n","print(\"Standard Deviation: {:.2f} %\".format(accuracies.std()*100))"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"sj8bdhSn1rg2","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1663515347205,"user_tz":-240,"elapsed":11615,"user":{"displayName":"Hadelin de Ponteves","userId":"15047218817161520419"}},"outputId":"1a296ee2-cf42-45d9-daa8-9447e2c8bf9b"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Average Accuracy: 86.51 %\n","Standard Deviation: 0.69 %\n"]}]}]}
